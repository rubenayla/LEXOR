All nouns must start with a consonant
All verb roots must start and end with a consonant. The conjugation will be done with a vowel at the end.
Design clear part-of-speech markers at word boundaries (prefix/suffix or start/end patterns) so the same root can shift between noun, verb, adjective, etc., without ambiguity.
