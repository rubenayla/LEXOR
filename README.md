# Lexor
**Lexor** is a constructed language aiming to maximize precision and efficiency in communication, from phonetics to grammar. Built from first principles, it emphasizes clarity, compactness, and logical structure. **Currently under development** and open for contributions.

Whenever possible, it will be based on English and Latin roots.

## Features
- **Phonetics**: Carefully selected set of phonemes with 1-to-1 character mapping.
- **Grammar**: Verb-Object-Subject (VOS) sentence structure for action-centric communication and consistent structure at the start of sentences.
- **Non-tonal**
- **Vocabulary**: Root-based vocabulary with a consistent structure to distinguish subjects, and conjugations.
