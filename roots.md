# Roots
If we had no limitations, we could create 16 * 7 = 112 consonant-vowel roots. This section will probably change as the language evolves.
With cons-vow-cons: 16 * 7 * 16 = 1792 roots. Enough

I'm thinking of starting words with consonants, since starting with a vowel is often almost impossible to hear.
The roots will be defined from top to bottom, creating a sense of priority, so the leftover roots will be used forward at the end of this file.
Reserve sets of roots for:
- personal pronouns
- other pronouns
- verb conjugations
    - Ending with vowels

## Personal pronouns (I, you, he...)
If we take a set of 3 people: me, you, and him, we have 3 individual pronouns, 3 pairs of two, and one for all of us. This gives us 7 pronouns. Now if you replace him by they, we get a new one. Any of the previous combinations won't be modified by adding more people, since it was already plural. We won't distinguish between "you and him" and "you and them", both are you plural. This gives us 9 pronouns. We will add a "we" that is generic, to not be obliged to defined whether the listener is included or not. The third-person pronouns (he/she/they) will be for people, so we will add 2 more for objects and concepts, singular and plural. This gives us 11 pronouns.

Phonemes were chosen for consistency and logical alignment: **`y`** represents the speaker (self), **`u`** the listener, and **`e`** external third parties (neutral). When talking about groups, **`l`** is added to the root, with the vowel of the excluded party (otherwise we'd need two vowels to make it consitent. I still find it intuitive). So you and him = `ly`, me and him = `lu`, you and me = `le`. For they we use `lo`, and for objects `i` and `li`.

## Verbs
TODO DECIDE WHETHER CONSONANT-VOWEL-CONSONANT AND THE TENSE IS A VOWEL AT THE END. FOR NOW IT'S THE IDEA.
