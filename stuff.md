# Language
- GPT prompt to help with this: Design a whole language following those guidelines, from the phonetics, to the writing, thinking about the structure of the words, if there are words, verbs etc.

[How to make a language - Part 1 - Biblaridion](https://youtu.be/FHK1gO2Mh68)

Define words in conversation easily fast. Simplify like when programming, makes it understandable.

Vocabulary with words that include sets of other words elegantly differentiated, with different levels of precision. Easy formation of new words with a system equivalent to prefixes and suffixes. Ex: to upvote, to google, I googled that, earphone, headphone, a redwood... I'm not sure about homonyms, special phrases: to hand something over... I like words that can be used in different ways: a redwood (noun), a redwood tree (adjective)...

Without word gender nor necessity to differentiate singular/plural. Information included in articles or the word itself. Without accents.

All nouns, adjectives, etc with the same ending? At least special sets of words.

Expression for [repeat with more precision, to make clear]:

Example: To make sure you are using the GPU (That is: Get IS CUDA AVAILABLE? = True)
Example phrase: I've heard that they're not going to be able to see each other
- Like Object oriented programming but remember things, like the class etc. For example describing where to click in a complex program gui


## Sounds
| **Group**       | **Sounds**                    | **Summary**                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stop Sounds**  | `p`, `t`, `k`, `b`, `d`, `g` | Sharp, distinct sounds for clear transitions between syllables.             |
| **Fricatives**   | `f`, `s`, `ʃ`, `z`, `v`      | Continuous sounds for modifiable durations, enhancing distinctiveness.      |
| **Affricates**   | `tʃ`, `dʒ`                   | Combination of stop + fricative, adding compact and efficient transitions.  |
| **Nasals**       | `m`, `n`, `ŋ`                | Smooth, resonant sounds that complement the clarity of other groups.        |
| **Vowels**       | `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `æ`, `ɒ` | Distinct vowels covering a wide acoustic range for easy differentiation.    |
| **Consonant Clusters** | `bl`, `tr`, `skr`, `str`     | Dense combinations of consonants, maximizing information per syllable.      |
| **Tonal Variations** | Rising, falling, flat, contour | Adds layers of meaning without increasing syllable length.                  |
| **Optional Clicks** | `ʘ`, `ǀ`, `ǃ`, `ǂ`, `ǁ`    | Distinct non-verbal sounds for extreme environments or unique words.        |

This sound system is designed to maximize efficiency and clarity for a high-bit-rate constructed language. Its **strong points** lie in its **balanced combination of distinct phonemes and tonal variations**. The inclusion of stops, fricatives, and vowels ensures a clear acoustic separation, allowing rapid articulation and reducing the risk of misinterpretation in noisy environments. The dense consonant clusters (e.g., `str`, `skr`) and affricates (`tʃ`, `dʒ`) maximize information density per syllable, enabling compact and meaningful expressions. Tonal variations further enhance the system by encoding additional layers of meaning without increasing syllable length, making it ideal for variable precision in communication. 

The **weaknesses** stem from potential **articulatory complexity and listener fatigue**. While dense clusters and tonal shifts are efficient, they demand precise control over speech production and auditory recognition, which might reduce usability in fast-paced or casual contexts. Nasal sounds and optional clicks help balance this by providing smoother transitions and distinct non-verbal elements, but they might require training for non-native users. 

Overall, this system strikes a **pragmatic balance** between maximizing information transfer and maintaining comprehensibility. It aligns well with the goals of compactness, speed, and clarity while offering flexibility for both general and precise communication. Adjustments may be needed based on cultural preferences or specific environmental requirements for the language's application.

## Things to note
- 
### Difference between big and large

### Difference between "a always equals b" and "a can be equal to b" (there exists a possibility in the set of all possibilities where a=b)

### Define the meaning of "a = b" is false. "a = b" is always false for all possibilities, or there exists at least one possibility where a=b is false. Maybe we need two words, or a modifier.


### How to express doubt or uncertainty built-in when thinking about possibilities
