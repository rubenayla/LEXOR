# TODO

## High Priority
- Include example of sympy in python, sp.Eq() analyzes equality in a strange way, if the two multivariable expression CAN be unequal, it returns False. It answers: "Are they always equal?" = "Are they identical expressions?".
- Reserve a root for comma-like behavior, specifically when you're going to use several synonyms or equivalent descriptions for something, to make it clearer.
    - Example: "I'll use scalar-first, wxyz, Hamilton convention". I used 3 different ways to refer to it to make it easier to understand, but that could be explicit, instead of looking like separate independent parameters.
- word for "ad with stuff to buy, may include several units of an item", if i want to buy 3 units of that ad, which itself has 5 units of the item, will result in 15 units of the item in total. How to express 3 units of that ad.
- "The password is incorrect"
    - Does it mean the password is literally "incorrect", or it's applying an adjective "incorrect" to the word password? I feel like the second case should use a different verb than "is". It's conceptually different.
- How to negate an adjective and a verb?
- Refine phonetic rules and finalize all unused phonemes.
- Expand roots for emotional states and complex logic.
- Validate sentence structure and test examples for consistency.

## Medium Priority
- Add conjugation and pluralization rules to `language_roots.md`.
- Experiment with verb modifiers for nuanced tense/aspect.
- Inverse form "Yo tengo un lapiz" -> "Un lapiz es tenido por mi".

## Low Priority
- Explore alternative sentence structures (if VOS proves limiting).
- Investigate digital tools for automatic word generation.
